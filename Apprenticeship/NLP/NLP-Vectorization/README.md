# Vectorization

The last steps in preparing our texts for modeling are stemming/lemmatizing and vectorizing.

## Learning Goals

- Lexicon normalization: lemmatization and stemming
- Run feature engineering algorithms for NLP
    - Bag-of-Words
    - Count Vectorizer
    - Term frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf)

## Lesson Materials

- [Jupyter Notebook: NLP Vectorization](nlp_vectorization.ipynb)
